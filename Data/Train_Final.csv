I'd like to say first of all that I think that you're version of the article looks fantastic and that it's so obvious that you've put time and effort into doing it. I've read the discography page and you're edit follows it to the book. However, I would like to suggest that you keep the 'additional singles section', the part with like, 'My love is Pink' and every thing else, in the same area. They are not 'Sugababes singles' for various reasons, which I can explain to you if you still do not understand. I prefer your version of the albums' section and you're introduction is much more explanatary, which I think is very useful. So I'm not critical of the whole article, just the singles section.

 Response 

1. Photo selection: On 3/15/07, I trimmed his four photos down to what I felt was the most representative one, even though trimming them to zero makes more common sense.  What did I do to balance out this trimming?  In the external links section, I added a link to Shankbone's gallery in Wiki Commons, which features all four pics.  Hence anyone can see all four photos with the click of a button.  """"Chivalry is truly not dead,"""" you say to yourselves.  (I even left the gallery/centered HTML around it, so that it'd be positioned right in the center for all to see, not off to one side.)  What does Shankbone then do?  He adds his other three photos back, and slyly keeps the link which I had added to his pics at the Commons.  His reasoning is that """"One photograph in a gallery looks odd.""""  He could have simply reverted to the prior version, but he looked over my changes and then only kept the one change that benefited him. He keeps talking about how he wants to compromise and work with other users, but every chance he gets, he puts himself above all other considerations and still refuses to cooperate. Why would he have even made the Commons gallery unless he understood that his photos were not main-article-worthy?  He made the Commons gallery in the first place since he correctly reasoned that that was a better location for them.  Now he has told me he will do his best to have me blocked from editing this article any further.

Back to what I previously brought up about him using this article for careerist purposes.  Why did he put his full name in the title of each of the .jpg files he uploaded?  (Roll your mouse over the photos, or attempt to download them to your hard drive, if you don't know what I'm talking about.)  That's unheard-of.  Unless, that is, he wants a lot of people to download them, and have his name conveniently attached in the file name, in case said downloaders ever want to contact the photographer and offer him $ to reprint them... 

How can he get as many people as possible to download them?  By making them as racy as possible, of course.  The point is: He could have posted clothed pictures without his name in them.  Or racy pictures without his name in them.  Or clothed ones with his name in them.  None of those possibilities would have raised the serious ethical questions that have been voiced here by multiple users.

2. Slant of article: Tara Subkoff is a professional actress. She designs (or designed, since IOC is apparently defunct) clothes on the side, though actually all she does is modify existing ones with the help of a partner.  Her entire varied, and usually quite daring, 13-year film career is reduced to this line of text: """"She has acted in over a dozen movies."""" (Technically, that counts as zero descriptive lines of her actual roles or of accolades she has received.)  However, one fashion show of hers, which took place over maybe a 2-hour span at most, is represented by around two thirds of the descriptive text in this article.  Does that seem right to anyone?  I'd like for even one Wikipedia user to lay out for me how this is correct.  Someone who had never previously heard of Subkoff would think that the U.S. media had some sort of frenzy over this one show she put on, and that her acting is so subpar as to deserve approximately 0.0 to 0.5 words per film role.  (And 100% of the two """"references"""" that he hastily added to this article are about this one-time event.)  Shankbone has consistently and subtly altered the emphasis of this article towards proving his point of view, at the expense of doing Subkoff's career justice.  In science, an experiment is never undertaken with the intent of molding the results towards proving one pre-desired hypothesis.  Any scientist who does so is branded as a sham and generally stripped of his tenure/degree/etc.  This is known as the scientific method, and has been followed for centuries.  Wikipedia was designed to be laid out in a very cold and scientific manner, to dispense nothing other than actual facts about certain objects and entities.  It's not an arena for positing one's own spin on objects and entities.  If you don't like cold and non-biased data, then Wikipedia isn't the place for you.  I often go to entries on my favorite bands/movies/etc. (and I'm even talking about ones that have drastically changed my life, or bands that I like enough to have interviewed them in the past) and delete anything with even the tiniest whiff of favoritism.

3. Style.com link: I went to the style.com link that Shankbone provided.  This link simply reinforces my position.  What it shows is 36 pictures of this event.  The models are topless in 6 of the pictures.  The models are fully clothed in 30 of the pictures.  Tell me how Shankbone's four topless pics provide an accurate overview of",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Calling for a movement to eliminate Biritsh spelling on wikipedia 

This is a very serious issue that needs to be confronted. It is not professional, non-NPOV, and inconsistent that we have some articles with British spelling, and others without. There are even some articles that deal with something thats exclusively American, such as the White House for example, that have some words spelled the British way. This should not be, and there should be some uniformity if we wish to have a professional and reliable encyclopedia.

Britian is the only English-speaking country that uses their own unique variation of the English language, and in British contexts, that's usually fine. But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds, and that should be the standard that Wikipedia uses. It makes absolutely no sense to use one country's variation of dialect, no matter how BIG, important, or """"popular"""" it is, and completely disregard the rest of the English-speaking world's orrect usage of the language. 

In fact, pretty much every article that contains a word that differs between the two dialects, the British version is favored. This, also, makes absolutely no sense. If the majority of a population speaks and/or writes a certain way, then it's institutions, endorsements, and websites should speak/write that certain way, too. It is understandable if this website was: www.wikpedia.co.uk, because that assumes that this is a primarily UK website. But, this website is: www.wikipedia.com, so it should follow the standard dialect that other """".com"""" use. 

This isn't in any way some sort of hate movement or opinion. This is an encyclopedia, and in encyclopedias, information must be consistent and reliable. Please take your time to think about this issue, for the uniformity of this encyclopedia will help ensure that the current and future quality standards will be upheld.

 Issues on Banned IP 

Howdy,

My name's Mark and I'm typing from TransportSA, a state government agency here in Sunny (well, sort of sunny) South Australia.

Noticed that this IP has been banned due to vandalism, and if I could, would highly recommend that you contact Internode about this.  Internode has been around as an ISP here in SA for a very very long time, and has a reputation of """"doing the right thing"""".  Could I recommend you contact Simon Hackket at Simon@Internode.on.net .. He's the CEO of the business, and a very active and involved person.  It may be quite possible that he could initiate some action against the *actual* vandal if you are able to provide a clean time and date that the offending IP did it's work.  I *think* actions like this would be against the agreement made with Internode on fair use.

In any case, he's a great guy who just won't ignore the issue.

Hope this helps.

Union Arizona territory did not exist until 1863, the campaigns occurred in 1861 and 1862, at the time of the Mesilla and Valverde engagements happened in the region of Confederate Arizona, this is fact. Whoever changed it back was seriously lazy about it, although I will not explain why.

Cuchullain, you say it should be named New Mexico Campaign because that is what most other people call it. Well I am sorry If I dont think we should babdly name an article because most people are too stupid to realize the fighting occurred in Arizona Territory aswell and not just New Mexico. 

As I said before I am changing this article back to """"East Arizona and New Mexico Campaign"""" because this title most accurately describes the location of the offensive.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

But, with users who have been substantial contributors that doesn't seem to apply as 1) others HAVE substantially contributed to the pages 2) it may well have impact on the project. The only justification for this deletion would be IAR in exceptional circumstances of real-life privacy violation or harassment. If it isn't that, then there is utterly no basis in policy or consensus. The discussion on AN, which I link above, bears that out. Courtesy blanking is better in such cases. g 

It's only four talk pages. There's absolutely no need for crazy statements like """"Your deletion is improper"""". We can get to the bottom of why the Mercury left and why he requested deletion, and deal with undeletion and courtesy blanking as soon as we know the full reasons behind the request.   

I've tried to contact Mercury, but for the moment, I've undeleted the pages, courtesy blanked them and protected them from further edits. I can't see anything which would cause any problems for Mercury, but if he does request their full deletion again and cites privacy concerns, I'll look favorably on such a request.   

(ec)Sorry, I probably over reacted. I'm fighting a larger war on routine deletions of talk pages and archives - and a general misunderstanding of the rtv, and what it allows. I believe that the deletion of usertalk pages of established users is only justified in exceptional circumstances of causing off-wiki difficulties (and, in such cases, IAR can be validly invoked.) If you are satisfied that, in this case, there are such circumstances, then I won't question your judgement or ask for details. However, you might perhaps consider whether selective deletion/oversight of offending posts, or courtesy deletion might be better. Having said that, I leave it with you - I'll say no more and I'll not contest whatever you finally decide. I'm going to take up the wider issue as a policy discussion (without naming you or this particular case). I've posted, in generalities, to the mailing list. Again sorry for my tone.g

I paid close attention to everything that was said, and, where possible, I will try to incorporate the (constructive) criticism towards being a better administrator. I'm taking things slowly for now, partially because it's the holiday season and there are plenty of off-wiki distractions. ) I'm also working my way through the Wikipedia:New admin school and double-checking the relevant policies, and will gradually phase into the use of the new tools.

761acf73d40b0e25,"""

As I'm sure many of you have surmised, there is something going on behind the scenes to which most editors of Wikipedia are not privy. My purpose here today is to expose it. In doing so, you may be tempted to minimize the problem by vilifying David Gerard or Carbonite, but their actions are only part of the surface manifestation, and penalizing them will only accentuate the dilemma. Finding fall-guys to punish will not fix the problem because the underlying problem is the system of punishment.

Systems of punishment
On Jpgordon's talk page, we see Carbonite punish the administrator with a forced """"time out."""" In response, Jpgordon leaves a message on Carbonite's talk page saying, """"Good call."""" Jpgordon's subservience to the system of punishment is directly evident in this example. Methods of indirectly empowering systems of punishment also exist.

We can disagree with Carbonite's methods while enabling them at the same time by acknowledging Carbonite's ability to control our will. But, does Carbonite have the innate ability to control our will, or do we grant him that power? Obviously, Carbonite cannot coerce us without our agreeing to allow him that authority. Our mind is our own, and our will is based purely on the systems we acknowledge.

When we buy into a system of punishment, as many of us have at Wikipedia, we are purchasing the whole package. It come complete with vandals, disrespect, flame wars, and content ultimately controlled by a very few individuals with little or no prescriptive editing experience.

Prescription
Language requires prescription. This is evident with a little thought-experiment involving two extremes. If you could only communicate with words that remained the same indefinitely after they are coined, communication would be entirely possible. However, in the opposite extreme, where official definitions instantly amended whatever meaning every disparate context assumed, propaganda and """"misuse"""" would soon render that language ineffectual.

Within the intended construct of Wikipedia, we don't have to understand how strong singular definitions empower a civilization. The Darwinism of thousands of disparate editors and competing ideas will naturally lead to a prescriptive definition. In areas of Wikipedia where we don't have top-down control of content, this is exactly what happens. Unfortunately, systems of punishment have become the rule at Wikipedia instead of the exception. Our love for this project creates expectations for its potential, but the fear of not reaching these expectations allows others to control us, closes our eyes to corruption and content control, and ultimately destroys the thing we love.

In reply to  you state in your edit summary for the """"Existence of God"""" article: """"Undid revision 256247715 by 74.4.222.208 (talk) Difference is of opinion is not vandalism. Omega point is fringe."""" That claim doesn't even make coherent sense, besides the fact that you replaced a literate entry with an illiterate edit.

Even if one incorrectly thinks that the Omega Point Theory is """"fringe,"""" that has no logical connection with the edit that Jeffro77 made. Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals).

Actually, the creator of the former Hooknose article agreed with my rationale and he personally merged it with the Human nose article, as I had suggested.

Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article.  The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright.  Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.  If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article.  There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut.

9]], 1999) was the first president of Croatia in
the 1990s.

Tuðman's political party HDZ (Hrvatska Demokratska
Zajednica, Croatian Democratic Union) won the first
post-communist multi-party elections in 1990 and
he became the president of the country. A year later he
proclaimed the Croatian declaration of independence. He
was reelected twice and remained in power until his death
in late 1999. In English, his surname is spelled
""""Tudjman"""".

The Communist

Franjo Tuðman was born in Veliko Trgovišæe, a village in
the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia.

During WWII Tuðman fought on the side of
Tito's partisans, where he
also met his future wife, Ankica. He became one of the
youngest generals in the Yugoslav People's Army in the
1960s — a fact which some observers linked to the
fact that he sprung from Zagorje, a region that gave few
Communist partisans.

Others have observed that Tuðman was probably the most
educated of Tito's generals (as regards military history,
strategy and the interplay of politics and warfare)
— this claim is supported by the fact that
generations of future Yugoslav generals based their
general exam theses on his voluminous book on guerilla
warfare throughout history: Rat protiv rata (""""War
against war""""), 1957, which covers topics as diverse as
Hannibal's drive across the Alps, the Spanish war
against Napoleon and Yugoslav partisan
warfare.

Tuðman left active army service in 1961 to found the
Institut za historiju radnièkoga pokreta Hrvatske
(""""Institute for the History of Croatia's Workers'
Movement""""), and remained its director until 1967.

The Dissident

Apart from the book on guerilla warfare, Tuðman wrote a
series of articles  attacking the Yugoslav
Communist establishment, and was
subsequently expelled from the Party. His most important
book from that period was Velike ideje i mali narodi
(""""Great ideas and small peoples""""), a monograph on
political history that collided with central dogmas of
Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the
interconnectedness of the national and social elements in
the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during [[World War
II|WWII]]).

In 1971 he was sentenced to two years of prison for
alleged subversive activities during the so-called
""""Croatian Spring"""".

The Croatian Spring was a reformist movement that was
actually set in motion by Tito and Croatian party
chief Bakariæ in the climate of
growing liberalism in the late 60s. It was initially a
tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but
it soon grew into mass manifestation of dissatisfaction
with the position of the Croatian people in
Yugoslavia, and it began to threaten the party's
political monopoly. The result was a brutal suppression by
Tito, who used the military and the police to crush
what he saw as the threat to his undivided power - Bakariæ
quickly distanced himself from the Croatian Communist
leadership that he himself helped gain power earlier, and
sided with the Yugoslav ruler.

During the turbulent 1971, Tuðman's role was that of the
dissident who questioned the central myth of modern
Serbian nationalism, the number of victims of
the Jasenovac concentration camp, as well as the role
of centralism in Yugoslav and the continuation of
ideology of unitary """"Yugoslavism"""". Tuðman felt that this
originally Croatian romantic pan-Slavic idea from the
19th century had been mutated in harsh realities in both
Yugoslav states into the front for a pan-Serbian drive for
domination over non-Serb peoples — from economy and

I am satisified that most of my edits in """"Criticism of Pokemon"""" was not deleted though, although I still felt the need to emphasize the part about Christianity as that section is about Christian's opinions of the Pokémon series. I had a conflict with Brandon about not sourcing that part where I didn't say source my statement about religion not being mentioned in the cartoon, but I do not think that has to be sourced as most of the members of PCP actually agrees that religion was never metioned. I do feel, however, that is the only article one can talk about religion in an article about Pokémon. With the exception of the word """"absurd"""" I agree with the terms. 

 Regarding the issue of ignoring me, I will disagree with this. I do feel that you should ignore me when I discuss religion in most Pokémon articles, but if I am not doing that, it could have detrimental consequences. I agree with The_Hybrid that the religion things has gone on long enough, ok.

I was highly disgusted with your approach towards others. Also, you seems to carry a PERSONAL UNFOUNDED BIAS against certain sources. Make yourself USEFUL at WP, improve articles, DO NOT MASS BUTCHER others edits. Instead of increasing you edit counts but butcher, butcher, butcher and leaving arrogant rude comments, better pick very few pages and improve those. BE productive, not destructive. It takes lot more effort to create than to destroy/butcher. Anyone can be a butcher, specially with inflated ego, arrogant attitude and unworthy authority. It takes lot more to be a constructive leader. Be a useful WP admin who leaves a POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT behind, please do not be WP DESTRUCTIVE TALIBAN BULLY.

89761d4a794b59a2,""":, please consider my beer analogy again.  It would be quite easy to find reliable sources saying that beer is made from malt, hops, yeast, and water.  Many people think this is the only way true beer should be made.  Nevertheless some people do make beer out of other ingredients.  Now it might be correct to say that 'traditional ale' is made only of these ingredients and it is certainly true that beer made according to the """"Bavarian Purity Law"""" should be made from only these ingredients.  

Is there no way you can temper your claim and also make it strictly more accurate and informative by saying something like 'traditional Korean kimchi is always fermented'.   

To:User:Martin Hogbin: Look. I would do it if it were true to my knowledge and/or there existed some reliable sources to confirm that. The saveur.com article, the only source against my claim that I consider at least semi-reliable, says """"It can also be eaten before it is allowed to ferment"""". Do you think this confirms the existence of unfermented kimchi against all sources I gathered? Someone might like to have a bite of Sauerkraut before it is fermented. 
I don't want to argue with you or something, but I have heard that beer is made from only malt, hops, and water in Germany (as it should be). Unfortunately, at least in Korea, Japan, and the U.S., most beer includes rice, potato, corn starch, and many other ingredients I think unnecessary. At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.
But kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled """"unfermented"""", maybe except for Japanses """"kimuchi"""" which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.) Nevertheless, I am willing to temper my claim if editors can find even a couple of reliable sources that say some kimchi is unfermented.

I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency...

While doing an assignment my instructor sent us to the Chicago Public Library site

It states, """"After she attended public school in Monroeville she attended Huntingdon College, a private school for women in Montgomery for a year and then transferred to the University of Alabama. After graduation, Lee studied at Oxford University. She returned to the University of Alabama to study law but withdrew six months before graduation.""""

Thought this might help if anyone would like to write it in wiki style.  I don't have the time. ;)  

 Black and White Ball
What's with the line about the Black And White Ball of Truman Capote's?  Is it really a pertinent biographical detail to say that Ms. Lee was extended an invitation?  Not being a scholar on the subject, I may be missing something, but if it's really important, could it be fleshed out a bit to make it clear that it's more than useless trivia?
 

Why a recluse?
I came to this article to discover why exactly Harper Lee became a recluse. It does not really say for sure. I would be interested in knowing that if anyone happens to know.

She didn't exactly become a recluse. She just doesn't give interviews or write novels. She does have friends and family and she travels frequently.  

 Misspelling? 

Is the word anticlimatic spelt wrong?
Is it """"anticlimactic""""?...yes it is. sorry unsigned comment by User:Emilgouliev
You're right. Feel free to correct typos and other errors yourself.  

 New or Nord? 

In the text body, the interviewer is Newquist, in the references it is Nordquist. Pls reconcile.

Oxford

Does anyone know what college Ms. Lee went to at Oxford and what she studied while there?

I believe she was studying law when she went to Oxford for a one-year exchange program from the University of Alabama. I can't find a reference to which college she joined.

 Wikipedia limits itself to information that is verifiable. Since there is no verifiable information about Lee's literary ambitions (and not much about her private life at all), the subject is not detailed here.

New York Times had a January 31 (2006) article with an update on Lee's life.unsigned comment by User:160.39.187.226

Claims of descent from Robert E. Lee

Our article claimed that Harper Lee was a descendant of the Confederate General. A reader sent an e-mail to the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association to confirm this. They advised: I regret that Harper Lee is not a descendant of General Robert E. Lee.  There is a chart of Gen. Lee's descendants on the Stratford web site www.stratfordhall.org.  Click on """"history"""" in the left navigation bar, then click on Robert E. Lee, scroll to the bottom of his page and see the link to his family tree.  General Robert E. Lee has very few descendants, considering that he had seven children.  None of his daughters married and only two of his sons had children.  I hope that this information is helpful.

The claim has been removed from our article.  
 Thank you for your research and correction. (direct link to Lee's family tree)

Hi bro. I'm expecting some help from you. There's an edit warring going on by an user User:Shivamsetu on pages of Patna and Bihar.

And that guy also has some proofs to put Bihar in east india (sources like same media group and bihar goverment sites and etc which says bihar an eastern indian state).
So bro, i wanna say that isn't it possible to put and show Bihar as an eastern as well as northern Indian state likewise Indian goverment categorized it into these two groups??

Basically both articles describe the same thing/process.

However, I would suggest burnout (textiles) is preferable to the current Burnout (clothing) title of the other page if """"burnout"""" is deemed more appropriate than """"devoré"""". They certainly need merging, although the question is, should Devoré or an alternative Burnout page with a more appropriate title be the new home for the information?

 Holodomor origin and use 

Hi, I'm sorry I referred to the topic in question as a 'conspiracy theory' - I need to learn to censor myself better on Wikipedia. -) 

In any case, I can share my experience with the word growing up in the Soviet Union in the 1980-90s. I was aware of the term ('Golodomor' in Russian transliteration) as the """"the great famine of early 1930s throughout the Soviet Union, predominantly in the Ukraine, but also in Southern Russia, due to the policies of the collectivisation and de-kulakization."""" There was no connection or comparisons to Holocaust in my mind, in part because the term Holocaust was not in use in the general discourse. It was as if WWII happened but Holocaust did not. That was really weird. 

Now, the term Holocaust in Russian is much more common. However, the two words look differently in Russian - Gogolomor and Holokost; so that's why (with my background) is hard to see a connection, although I'm more aware now of how it became a political rather than just a historic term. 

Hope this clarifies my perspective. Again, sorry about the choice of language on the Holodomor Talk page.

then Epagum days begin July 5 in 2001 BC so that the July 10 solstice is Pamenot 1 not 6.
Every disagreement in short Genesis has a counterpart application in Egypt.
Example, reunification in year 955. If Flood is year 600, and Noah dies in year 350,
he dies in the year 350 that the Pharaoh was created.
If using a 360-day calendar for those 350 years, then from year 600 it is year 955.
Unification of dynasties 1-5 is then the same year and event for dynasties 6-10.
The 5th being dead in Genesis in year 340, but in LXX in year 768.
The date 1872 BC July 17 is Memphis. But what if its at Fort Quban where
sothis rises on July 10 the solstice during the 12th dynasty. That blows those
who try to trace July 20 back to a Gregorian solstice in 4242 BC.
And at the time of that July 10 date in the year 120 of the 12th dynasty,
let's say 1824 BC July 10 as second month Parmuti 16 (versus 8th month 22)

 HST > Notable? 

832, In the heading it says: """"Notable roles"""". The three previous mentions were roles that the play and/or film, Truman was the main subject, taking up the bulk of screen/stage time and lines. These also won critical acclaim. The combination of the amount of script and praise is what made these portrayals of Truman notable. Does your addition really fit: """"Notable""""? There have been lots of roles with Truman in them:

Flags of Our Fathers (2006) Played by David Patrick Kelly (as President Truman)
Hiroshima (2005) (TV) Played by Kenneth Jay (as Truman)
The Messenger: Based on a True Story (2005) Played by Raymond Starzmann (as President Truman)
Keep the Faith, Baby (2002) (TV) Played by Cedric Smith (as U.S. President Truman)
""""Futurama"""" - Roswell That Ends Well (2001) TV episode, Played by Maurice LaMarche (as President Harry Truman)
""""The Korean War"""" (2001) TV series Played by Harris Shore (as President Harry Truman)
""""The Simpsons"""" - The Trouble with Trillions (1998) TV episode, Played by Dan Castellaneta (as President Truman)
""""Dark Skies"""" - Moving Targets (1996) TV episode, Played by Hansford Rowe (as President Harry Truman)
Truman (1995) (TV) Played by Gary Sinise
Hiroshima (1995) (TV) Played by Kenneth Welsh (as President Harry S Truman)
Brenda Starr (1989) Played by Ed Nelson (as President Harry S. Truman)
Day One (1989) (TV) Played by Richard Dysart (as President Harry S. Truman)
""""War and Remembrance"""" (1988) TV series Played by Richard Dysart (as President Harry S Truman)
J. Edgar Hoover (1987) (TV) Played by Walker Edmiston
Eleanor, First Lady of the World (1982) (TV) Played by Richard McKenzie
Inchon (1981) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)
Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb (1980) (TV) Played by Ed Nelson (as President Harry S Truman)
""""Backstairs at the White House"""" (1979) TV series Played by Harry Morgan (as President Harry S. Truman)
MacArthur (1977) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)... aka MacArthur, the Rebel General (UK) 
Tail Gunner Joe (1977) (TV) Played by Robert Symonds (as President Harry S. Truman)
Harry S. Truman: Plain Speaking (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders
Truman at Potsdam (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S Truman)
Collision Course: Truman vs. MacArthur (1976) (TV) Played by E.G. Marshall (as President Harry S Truman)... aka Collision Course (USA: short title) 
Give 'em Hell, Harry! (1975) Played by James Whitmore (as Harry S Truman)
The Man from Independence (1974) Played by Robert Vaughn (as Harry S Truman)
The Beginning or the End (1947) Played by Art Baker (as President Harry S. Truman)

But, Give 'em Hell, Harry! and Truman, both on stage and screen where entirely about Truman. In Give 'em Hell (if you have seen it), there is nobody else. It is a one-man play, 100% of the lines are portraying Truman. And Flanders played Truman at least four times, including the bulk of the work being about him in at least two occasions; Harry S. Truman: Plain Speaking and Truman at Potsdam. So, is his charactership in Flags of Our Fathers really """"notable""""?

You even misquoted from the original. This not even sneaky vandalism - it's blatant, purposeful, organized, and relentless.

To reitirate my point on Ordu:talk, your sources are not NPOV. Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view I never argued with you about their Academic credentials even though the specific claims made by them are uncorroborated by any other Academic dead or alive. Dardian, the originator of your claim himself has not ever explicity said """"there was genocide in Ordu"""". You are interpreting - which is your POV on top of his POV!! Dardian is now the director of a Armenian Genocide Research organization. You can not honestly expect anyone to believe you that are they are NOPV sources and that you are doing this to improve that quality of WP.

 Edits proposed to plot description 

""""“Joliet” Jake Blues is released from the Joliet Correctional Center after serving three years of a prison sentence after being convicted of armed robbery.""""

Entry for Joliet Correctional Center.

""""Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own.""""

It's unclear here, however the Caddy Jake refers to may be Murph and the Magictones' pink vehicle first seen in the """"Howard Johnson's"""" scene where Jake and Elwood phone Maury Sline and are blasted the flame-throwing mystery woman. 

The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment).

Part of the film's humour is the actual name of the orphanage. Credit to Kathleen Freeman. People erroneously thing charities and churches are completely tax-exempt; however the exemption most notably only extends to Federal income taxes. The property tax bill would probably have remained an unforeclosed lien had the church not decided to sell voluntarily to the Board of Education.

""""At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Show Band and Revue.""""

Credit to Cab Calloway and James Brown.
  
""""As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall.""""

Entry for Bluesmobile; since location in Chicago and Illinois is obviously a major plot element, reference that the particular law-enforcement agency here is the ISP; SCMODS article already exists, with explanation of the meaning, in this context; article exists for Dixie Square Mall. 

""""After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher).""""

Credit cast member Carrie Fisher; this scene is cut from many televised versions, DVD featurette commentary explains that Canadian actor Aykroyd felt this scene explained the Bluesmobile's magical abilities, yet director Landis felt this was not transparent.

""""The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room. The mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.""""

Candy's character was important because he assisted in locating Elwood's abode; the 'Wrigley Field bit' is important plot-element humor.

""""Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with",0,0,0,0,0,0

Similarly, saying her """"role in a potential Giuliani administration"""" and not saying (even in footnote) what was controversial, I think is misleading.  There may be a few other places too.

 Regarding the bias and illogic of your edit, the excuse in your edit summary doesn't make sense, as it doesn't explain why you deleted mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since you yourself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in your own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that you consider the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, you deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

 So by your own words, you must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet you deleted mention of this endoresement in an area where you yourself agree that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God.

 the following should be included 

Child Porn Charges

It is noteworthy that instead of watching his daughter and protecting her, Mark Lunsford was allegedly busy on the internet viewing child pornography. Ironically, many of the """"Jessica's laws"""" that Lunsford fought so hard to get on the books dealt heavy blows to viewers of child porn, like Mark Lunsford, yet, Lunsford was never prosecuted under the existing federal laws for viewing child porn which would have landed Lunsford in federal prison and required him to register as a sex offender. Contained in the documents released by the State Attorney's office were notes from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that mention child pornography on Mark Lundsford computer. The images & documents were found Feb. 24 — the day Jessica was reported missing from her South Sonata Avenue home — Assistant State Attorney Pete Magrino said the images were found on Lunsford's computer. However, he said his office is not pursuing charges. [3]

Plastic Surgery

Lunsford surprised many in July 2007 when he appeared in the media having undergone several cosmetic surgeries, including a face lift, dermabrasion, and eye surgery. 4

Father of Child Molester

In 2007, Joshua Lunsford, Mark Lunsford's son was arrested for having molested a 14 year old girl in Ohio. Despite Lunsford's public attack on all sex offenders, he seemed to be ready and willing to defend his own son's sex crimes and in fact may have played a vital role in the unequal treatment of Mark's sexual predator son. Joshua Lunsford was ordered to undergo sex offender evaluation but special treatment was administered and Joshua avoided felony charges and sex offender registration.[5]""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 More information on Lenin's partial Jewish ancestry 
The following quotes regarding Lenin's partial Jewish ancestry are from The Jewish Century by Yuri Slezkine (Princeton University Press, 2004) and could possibly be inserted in to this article in order to provide more references.

 """"But of course the most sensitive """"nationality"""" [ethnicity] of all was Lenin's. In 1924, Lenin's sister Anna discovered that their maternal grandfather, Aleksandr Dmitrievich Blank, had been born Srul (Israel), the son of Moshko Itskovich Blank, in the shtetl Starokonstantinov [Old Konstantinov] in Volynia [Volhynia, now Ukraine]. When Kamenev found out, he said, """"I've always thought so,"""" to which Bukharin allegedly replied: """"Who cares what you think? The question is, what are we going to do?"""" What """"they,"""" or rather, the Party through the Lenin Institute, did was proclaim this fact """"inappropriate for publication"""" and decree that it be """"kept secret."""" In 1932 and again in 1934, Anna Ilinichna [Lenin's sister] begged Stalin to reconsider, claiming that her discovery was, on the one hand, an important scientific confirmation of the """"exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe"""" and """"the extraordinarily beneficial influence of its blood on the offspring of mixed marriages""""; and, on the other, a potent weapon against anti-Semitism """"owing to the prestige and love that [Vladimir] Ilich [Lenin] enjoys among the masses."""" Lenin's own Jewishness, she argued, was the best proof of the accuracy of his view that the Jewish nation possessed a peculiar """"'tenacity' in struggle"""" and a highly revolutionary disposition. """"Generally speaking,"""" she concluded, """"I do not understand what reasons we, as Communists, may have for concealing this fact. Logically, this does not follow from the recognition of the full equality of all nationalities."""" Stalin's response was an order to """"keep absolutely quiet."""" Anna Ilinichna did. The enemies of the regime were deprived of additional anti-Semitic ammunition"""" (pgs. 245–246)

 """"All advanced Jews supported assimilation, according to Lenin, but it is also true that many of the """"great leaders of democracy and socialism"""" came from """"the best representatives of the Jewish world."""" Lenin himself did [have Jewish ancestry], through his maternal grandfather, although he probably did not know it. When his sister, Anna, found out, she wrote to Stalin that she was not surprised, and """"this fact"""" was """"another proof of the exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe,"""" and that Lenin had always contrasted """"what he called its 'tenacity' in struggle with the more sluggish and lackadaisical Russian character."""" (p. 163)

 """"And in 1965, all archival documents relating to Lenin's Jewish grandfather were ordered """"removed without leaving any copies."""" (pg. 338)

But, the resulting view seems to imply bias in your preceding considerations. For instance, you've assumed I wanted Roux gone, when there's never been any such expressed desire from me, either im- or explicitly, neither before nor now. It also seems that you've excused Roux for some of the behaviour you admonish me for (not to say I feel I should be excused from anything I've done).
If I may express my opinion, Roux is a good editor, but generally only when working alone or without opposition or critique; yes, I bare my own biases, but I come to that conclusion having seen his interactions with others in addition to my own experiences, and recent events seem to show that it isn't changing. It is my sense that in these circumstances he genuinely believes himself to be a victim, and, seemingly sensing some threat, responds to the most gentle criticism with the most vicious vitriol. While that can cause some problem in itself, the preverbal shit hits the fan when thrown into the mix are stubborn individuals who don't buy his claims of innocence and casualty, after which the intensity of the conflict increases exponentially. If it wasn't already obvious: I am one of those stubborn persons, believing we alone are responsible for our own actions. Thus, I honestly don't for one minute buy that Roux was """"driven"""" to do anything; he chose to participate here in the manners that he did, both good and bad, and he chose to leave; just as I chose to participate in the manners that I did, chose to leave, chose to come back, chose to leave again, chose to come back, and choose to admit much of my editing habits were the wrong way to go about things.

QUOTE:
Several mechanisms have been proposed where warmth builds up in the equatorial area, then is dispersed to higher latitudes {NORTH?] y an El Niño event. [WHAT MECHANISMS? HOW IS BUILD-UP AND DISPERSAL RELEVANT??]

The cooler area [WHERE IS THAT?] then has to """"recharge"""" warmth for several years before another event can take place.[citation needed]

The Madden-Julian Oscillation is not a cause of the phenomena, but propagates eastward around the global tropics with a cycle on the order of 30-60 days, and may significantly influence the speed of development and intensity of El Niño and La Niña. 2.

Tropical cyclones north and south of the equator that may play a role in ENSO are caused by the westerly flow between the areas of low pressure induced by a Madden-Julian oscillation.[4] [WHAT DOES THIS MEAN??]

Such wind may counteract the typical easterly flows across the Pacific and create a tendency toward continuing the eastward motion.[citation needed] [A COUNTERACTION OF EASTERLY FLOWS CREATES TENDENCY TOWARD EASTWARD MOTION??]

Eastward-propagating oceanic Kelvin waves can be produced by Madden-Julian activity, which may in turn be influenced by a developing El Niño, leading to a positive feedback.[5] [HOW IS THIS PRODUCED, HOW IS THIS INFLUENCED?}

No point in concealing the fact that oil and gas exports and petroleum price play important role in the Russian economy. However there is no point in highlighting this fact too much since it borders with spreading the myth that Russian economy is only oil and gas and nothing or almost nothing else.
Few facts:
Significant growth of oil prices started only in 2004-2005, but the Russian economy started growth (and rather large growth) well in 1999-2000. 
Russian economy is not only export. The recovery of oil and gas and other minerals was only 9% of GDP in 2011  and only 6.8% was oil and gas  (with figures not much larger in the previous years). The share of oil and gas in GDP gradually falls.
Unprocessed oil and gas takes only 45% of Russian exports. More of the rest are oil-based products and fuels, but this is considered manufacturing . So the phrase in one of the last edits about the """"oil and gas, which is the majority of Russian exports"""" is oversimplified, and certainly not correct if we speak about raw materials vs manufacturing.
Federal budget grew much faster in the last decade than oil prices . And it is not clear whether """"a five-fold increase in price of oil and gas"""" is correct description - it was four-fold increase in 2000-2011, but seven times increase in 1999-2011.
In 2008 only 23% of federal budget revenues came from exports oil and gas (customs tariffs), and 18% from taxes on petroleum and mining companies . However, when we speak about the consolidated budget (federal budget + regional budgets) the similar figures for oil and gas would be just 14% and 10% .
All this means the following:
The economic growth in the early 2000s was not very much dependent on oil and gas prices. So it is incorrect to ascribe early economic growth under Putin to petroleum prices.  
Overall, the dependence (whatever its scale) of the Russian economy on oil and gas is not Putin's invention, and the share of this sector in the Russian GDP actually is falling.
However, oil and gas money constituted a very large share of the federal (but not so consolidated) budget in the Putin era. This means that it is more correct to speak that it is not the Russian economy on the whole, but the federal budget which is dependent on oil and gas.
And a qualitative addition to the figures: Russia is a northern cold country and Russia is industrial country, which means that it needs lots of fuel for itself, but it is also a (very) resource-rich country, so no wonder that it produces much energy, have lots of facilities for that, and takes the opportunity to export abroad a lot (every country in similar conditions does that: the U.S. , Canada, Norway). This is not good or bad feature of the economy, just the fact.  Talk 
We need to revert your additions on oil and gas simply because they are not entirely correct factually, and because all the key information in more generalized and accurate form is already in the lead. But if you have proposals to make some important additions in accurate wording, let's discuss them.  Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You raise several interesting points.

On the matter of plagiarism in general: Yes, you're right; if a Wikipedia page is remarkably similar to a page elsewhere, that doesn't mean that the WP page plagiarized the other: it could have been the other way around, or something more complex may have happened.

On this page: Its history shows an almost uninterrupted growth to this state, before the trimming started. I haven't examined the growth, but yes, gradual growth (as opposed to sudden jumps in size) suggests that the editorial work went on here. So perhaps I was too hasty.

Here is Graham's page about himself. I now notice that it says at its foot Excerpt from Gallery Press Release, 2008. So it's possible that it copied the press release which itself was a copy of the WP article.

So maybe I have an """"overly critical attitude"""". But if so, it's an overly critical attitude toward the editing, not Graham's work. (I've seen some of his early work from Beyond Caring and think it's very good; I know little about his other work.)

Why the apparent concentration on Japan? First, it's hardly a concentration; it's simply the addition of a sourced fact. And, if you're interested, here's how it came about. Having created Category:Photography in Japan, I populated it. Racking my brain for non-Japanese photographers who'd done a significant amount of work in Japan was a pleasant activity for a commuter trip or three; I also emailed a couple of friends more knowledgable about the matter than I am. Graham's name came up, either to one of them or to me. I was certain that he'd done work in Japan so I put this in  in accordance with WP policy, backing up the assertion with a reliable source. 

This was a contribution of time and energy, though admittedly a tiny one. Graham's work seems to have many admirers. I was hoping and expecting that among themselves they'd rebuild the article. I'd be willing to help with this. While not working on Graham's article, I've been working on articles about other photographers.

So let's turn back the clock to September 2008, before the cuts. Here's a paragraph:

Graham was the first photographer to combine the sensibility of contemporary colour photography with classic British social documentary. In 1981/2 he made A1—The Great North Road, a book of 40 colour photographs taken along the length of the British A1 road, which had a transformative effect on the black and white tradition that had dominated British art photography till that point. This work, along with Graham's later photographs of the 1980s -  the colour images of unemployment offices in Beyond Caring (1984-85), and the sectarian marked landscape of Northern Ireland Troubled Land (1984-86) - were pivotal in reinvigorating and expanding this area of photography, by both broadening it's visual language, and questioning our notions of what such photography could say, be, or look like. Photographers like Martin Parr made the switch to colour soon after, and a new school of British Photography evolved with the subsequent colour work of Richard Billingham, Tom Wood, Paul Seawright, Anna Fox, Nick Waplington, etc.

Let's suppose for a minute that this is legitimate WP text, and not ripped off from somewhere else. Its content is a mixture of the easily verifiable and the arguable. Was he the first photographer to make this combination? Did this one book have a transformative effect? Why """"British art photography"""" (my emphasis)? How were they """"pivotal""""? This stuff would have to be sourced. (Yes, writing for WP is a bitch.)

Backing for some and perhaps even all of this is probably within Williams' text for How We Are and Mellor's for No Such Thing as Society. Do you have either of these?    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 MSM 

Agreed

Every single source I have and Puellanivis has referred to has said that TG/TS women are considered MSM or """"along side"""" MSM. The much vaunted CDC source made it sound even less ambigous. Her very own source backed me! That TG/TS women are for the CDC's and any other medical purpose biologically male, that the MSM category does not take into account any aspec of identity. Which would include gender identity. Case closed.

The rest of this has just been about Puella and her personal feelings.   

No, my source states that gender identity is not tracked at all, so the assumption on their part is that everyone is reported as they """"biological"""" sex.  However, again, if a TS/TG were reported as female, since no gender identity information would be collected there would be no indication of which were which.  Literally TS/TG information is entirely intermingled, in some indeterminable amount.  The ambiguity of not collecting TS/TG information means that there is simply a blanket assumption about how the information is received from the CDC... the true answer is, because of the ambiguity no one knows how they're split up... the data is intermingled, and there is no way to separate the information.  Again, the answer from the CDC and from your sources is that the assumption is that MTF TS/TG are reported as MSM, and FTM are just pretty much ignored... N.B. assumption... since gender identity information isn't collected no one can say what it is.  Again, being that my medical records indicate me as female, and I continue to be asked """"are you pregnant?"""" when getting x-rays indicates that I would not be reported as a male to the CDC.  Without collecting gender identity information, no one can with certainty that all TS/TG are recorded as MSM.

Barnstar

  The Tireless Contributor Barnstar I haven't left a barnstar on Wikipedia for a very long time. Sometimes when you are closely working with somebody you neglect to reward them for things that are really, really great. During my time on Wikipedia, I have seen you grow from a contributor who makes edits every now and then - almost solely contributing to Aquinas College, Perth to a wide PSA school scope. Recently I have stopped my contributions to PSA articles, for reasons both you and I know. I have realised my thank yous over the year you and I have been working together for have culminated in something a little larger. By comparison, you have probably been the editor I have worked with the most. I look forward to working with you in the future. Until then, here's a barnstar in recognition of your efforts in Australian schools articles. Soon enough, I hope to be joining your PSA watch you emailed me about.

Metalcore is a modern fusion of both hardcore punk and heavy metal. Metalcore is known for its emphasis on breakdowns and heavy guitar riffs. Screamed vocals dominate metalcore. Singing is usually present, but the emphasis is on screamed vocals. A lot of bands that are casually referred to as """"hardcore"""" or """"metal"""" are actually metalcore bands. Metalcore has practically taken over the heavy metal music scene.
Screamo is one specific derivative form of hardcore punk. It has nothing to do with heavy metal. It denotes a fusion of hardcore punk and emo, generally featuring emotional lyrics, transitions from soft to heavy passages, and screamed vocals accompanied by more melodic singing. The word screamo is misused all the time. People often call any music with screaming in it """"screamo"""". But screamo is actually only one specific genre. The genre itself is still very popular. There are lots of modern screamo bands that more-or-less still meet the same basic stylistic requirements of screamo.
Post-hardcore is a direct derivative of hardcore punk (hence the title post-hardcore). It simply defines any modern hardcore punk with high levels of experimentation. I know you didn't ask about this genre, but I felt it appropriate to mention. Post-hardcore represents a very wide range of musical styles. Post-hardcore bands may take influence from many other styles of music, and are often closely associated with alternative rock or punk. What identified post-hardcore, though, is the inclusion of hardcore punk elements like screamed vocals. If a band uses screamed vocals and heavy instrumentation, but is not heavy enough to be considered metalcore, then the band will often be labeled post-hardcore. 90.205.53.223  ericdeaththe2nd90.205.53.223  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I know lots of fat women - men too - and I have yet to hear of even one - in all history - exploding into flame, even after death in a house... fire.  I don't know if you are trying to be humorous or if this is really their level of competence. If they can cite the fat cremation thing go ahead - their """"reliable"""" sources have been called unreliable by other of their """"reliable"""" sources ( when a person finds one of these they are within minutes of being banned ( it must really rancle goofs to only have the power to ban - sounds like a bunch of not too bright kids on the playground)). PS The entire structure of your history... articles smells more of propaganda than information. The Duesberg articles are particularly embarrassing - not being able to even get partway through one of his points without starting to foam at the mouth is starting to become a hallmark of wiki. Keep it up - best way.only way to kill the project is by insiders. It's actually fun to watch - fat ladies are watching your every move, and laughing( good exercize).159.105.80.141  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Comment 

My comments on Malleus' talk page were well beyond civil, even for a user talk page. They were a personal attack, and warranted serious sanction. 

For the record, it was a simple spontaneous eruption of contempt mingled with rage. Some have muttered that I went to his page to harass him; that's not the case. I went to continue a discussion that had been interrupted by earlier admin action. Some are muttering that I went there to """"bait"""" or """"poke"""" him into a block. I appreciate the complement but my Machiavellian intelligence is non-existant. Obviously. 

I lost respect for Malleus when he said, """"You already succeeded in getting me blocked, so I can only presume that you're trying to repeat the trick."""" I had made it clear that I had no intention of getting him blocked, he knew it, and yet regurgitated this populist slur. That's where he opened the door for my unmitigated opinion.

But my rant wasn't aimed at the dishonesty I perceived in that comment, that simply gave me permission to express a much deeper revulsion that's been building in me over the last few months with respect to this project. 

It's a feeling, so I'm not sure I can make it clear. A kind of nauseous disgust. It's to do with how we deal with the hurt we may cause others, other editors, our subjects and our readers. I'm pleased to see the faltering steps being taken toward a more civil ethos here. Those who actually know me know that means a great deal to me. There is a long way to go. Pesky pointed out that finding the right form of words for what's required is difficult. I agree. That's the challenge. The right form of words will emerge if we discuss these questions enough.

With regard to respectful discourse between editors, Malleus has been addressing the real root of the civility problem here for years. Telling someone to fuck off, or calling them a cunt is obviously uncivil and an easy call for an admin. But the real evil here is not Malleus and me calling each other names, it's the sleazy aside from one editor to another, undermining the reputation of a third. One editor can bully or badger another for days or weeks without ever calling them a name, and it's their victim that cops a block when they respond accordingly. So I'm glad to see more admins taking civility seriously, but you're going to have to work on the sophistication of your approach.

I'm disgusted by the way this project treats its readers with regard to controversial images. The bit that disgusts me is the mantra that """"we don't care if we offend our readers."""" Seriously. That has been repeated ad nauseam during the Muhammad images debates and others. I can see no excuse for that attitude, and don't want to participate in an enterprise that has that attitude towards its readership.

And finally, contempt for our subjects. I first noticed this on a BLP. A teenage girl and her boyfriend made a sex tape. Later, when she was a minor local celebrity, the tape was posted on the net, without her permission. It's there now; Google her name and """"sex tape"""" and you got it. She's now won a TV competition, so is becoming better known.

The tape's existence has been mentioned a few times in the press, but not much, and usually the """"nudge, nudge, lucky bastard"""" type of comment, but it doesn't seem to have affected her career or even her private life. An RfC asked """"Should we mention the tape?"""" Policy-wise you can make a case for its inclusion, but it's borderline. What really disgusted me was the utter unconcern of many editors for the effect our inclusion of the factoid would have on the visibility of the tape, and the consequent effect this would have on the woman. I won't elaborate further; you either get it or you don't.

And it was concern for the subject of a BLP that brought Malleus and me together. He was arguing for the preservation of a borderline notable BLP that the subject said was distressing him. I argued that it should go, simply because it's borderline notable and the subject doesn't want it. 

Although Malleus asserted the wishes of the subject are irrelevant, an assertion he is incapable of justifying, and a position I find morally repugnant, he deemed it appropriate to also declare the subject's claim of distress is implausible. Unfortunately, Jimbo had already primed me with a similar judgment. Jimbo had ignored my response, so I thought I'd add a little emphasis when I explained my view to Malleus.

That was the first time I ever saw her act, and I loved her in it.

And the irony of her now being on DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, is that she's reunited with actor Doug Savant, and their 2 characters when they were on M.P. were good friends who stuck together!

Has she disassociated herself from that show, or is it just a large omission from this article?

I'm not an anarchist, either; I see States as a necessary evil given the current state of human civilization. But they should not be glorified as a an end, but as a means to an end, the end being peace, security for ALL, democracy, people before profits, equality ect (progressive values). 

States should never be supported when they rest on the oppresssion of others. I oppose all conquest and imperialism, past and present. As far as states created by conquest, what is important is current oppression, i.e.  ending it,(esp. state-sponsored) that are in the bussiness of building based on conquest of others. This must be opposed equally in all cases, which a special responsiblity for those you can have the greatest effect in changing, stoping, i.e. if I live in the US, I have a special responsiblity to speak out against things this countries does (directly or indirectly as in the case of support for Israeli occupation).

As for the meaning of a national homeland, it could mean the country of origin and native land of a people who have a strong cultural connection and history within such a territory , a cultural geography. There are many ethnic groups who holds a long history and a deep cultural association different country or geographical regions, in particular where the national identity began. And, diffferent groups can live in peace side to side, with different language, cultures, co-existing with the same country, united under the common accepted cultural norms of democratic values. This does not negate a national homeland, only having it based on the oppression of others.

A single article to cover both would be sufficient as they were VERY closely related and differed mainly in size and engine arrangements, i.e. merge them.
A variants section to explain the differences between the BN3, and T variants.
Try to use your own prose instead of parrotting references.
Avoid adding superfluous details, such as the various competing aircraft which should only get fleeting mentions at best.

Just some suggestions, but if you look at the articles again objectively you may see my points. 

Good luck and carry on writing articles.",0,0,0,0,0,0

cee3e5625016d8d7,"A Short History of Republican Sinn Féin  

In 1902, Arthur Griffith, Editor of the United Irishman, presented to the third annual convention of Cumann na nGaedheal the most revolutionary political idea since the fall of Parnell; it was that the elected Irish Members of Parliament should refuse to sit in Westminster, demand reinstitution of the Irish Parliament of 1782, and pledge allegiance only to a king of Ireland, not to the King of England. While the Liberator, Daniel O’Connell, had once considered such unilateral action, he had not forced the issue. Griffith provided a strategy of passive resistance by turning an assembly of Irish MPs into a de facto constitutional convention. Modeled on Frank Deak’s policy, which resulted in the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, Griffith serialized his abstentionist program in the United Irishman as the Resurrection of Hungary, and then published it as a pamphlet and distributed it widely in 1904. The direct result of this idea was the formation of Sinn Féin on 28th November 1905, as an abstentionist political party, with internal self-reliance as its principal plank, pledging never to recognize or use the services or forces of the enemy. The founders of Sinn Féin were Arthur Griffith, Seán T. O’Kelly, Bulmer Hobson, Countess Markiewicz and Seán Mac Diarmada. In addition to contesting a Parliamentary election in North Lietrim in 1908, Sinn Féin was also active locally, electing a number of men to county councils and other local bodies. 

Historian, lecturer, Conradh na Gaeilge president and Radio Free Éireann (public service broadcasting, 99.5 FM in New York) commentator Nollaig Ó Gadhra points out that the big change in Sinn Féin came in the Árd Fheis of 1917, when the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) under the guidance of Michael Collins and the Irish Volunteers under Cathal Brugha, caused Sinn Féin to change its policy from monarchist to republican abstention. After the Rising, Sinn Féin adopted an election manifesto for all elections, insisting upon the Irish Republic Proclaimed on Easter Monday, 1916. Éamonn deValera, campaigning in an Irish Volunteer uniform, was elected for East Clare in June 1917. At the Árd Fheis of Sinn Féin in October 1917, Arthur Griffith graciously stepped down from President to Vice President of Sinn Féin, to allow the election of deValera, who, after the death on hunger strike of Thomas Ashe, was the senior surviving Commandant from 1916. 

This was the Sinn Féin which contested the general election of 14 December 1918, promising to NOT represent their constituents or their country in the mighty Westminster Parliament in London, but rather to set up, without foreign let or hindrance, a Republican assembly which would form an Irish government for Ireland. Sinn Féin won over 79% of the popular vote in all Ireland, and 73 of 105 seats, in what can only be described as a plebiscite for independence. The delegates who assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin formed the First Dáil Éireann and issued the Irish Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919 (legally the equivalent of the American Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress, promulgated on the 4th of July 1776). That Easter Monday, 1916 is regarded as the significant date is a consequence of the pre-existing Army Council of the Irish Republican Army – Óglaigh na hÉireann (the IRA) insisting upon the First Dáil Éireann recognizing the Irish Republic proclaimed in arms in 1916, as a condition for the IRA coming under the authority of the government formed by the First Dáil Éireann. [See also Dorothy Macardle, The Irish Republic (New York, 1965).] 

The democratic voice of the Irish people had spoken (vox populi, vox Dei), and their elected representatives sought the recognition of their national self-determination as promised by American President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, on which basis the Armistice ending the Great War on 11 November 1918, had been accepted by the Central Powers. Ireland was denied recognition and a seat at the Versailles peace conference. The ensuing conflict between the forces of the Imperial Government in London and the Irish Republic has become known to history as the “Black and Tan War” (1919-1921). But, the military lessons of Dublin 1916 having been studied in the internment camp of Frongoch, the forces of the Irish Republic waged an asymmetrical conflict against the alien forces of occupation. Modern guerilla warfare entered on to the twentieth century. England, though still in control of many strong points, could no longer coerce Ireland into remaining peacefully within her empire. A Second (Republican) Dáil Éireann came together in August 1921 (124 Sinn Féin and 4 Unionist members). Nollaig Ó Gadhra, in Civil War in Connacht (Cork & Dublin: Mercier Press, 1999), points out that the Sinn Féin delegates regarded their mandate to be as Teachta Dála Éir",0,0,0,0,0,0

(insurgents don't have missiles), and having a """"missile"""" that doesn't make a sound is not possible and should not be given any credence. Also, the plane did not crash """"1.5 miles"""" from the base. The hull of the plane and all the wreckage was about 200m from the fence, consistent with an attempted landing.

I am perfectly glad, and have been all along, to see this section totally removed from this article. When we spun out the fuller version of this, I wanted to delete this shortened version from here. However, if it stays, I remain concerned what it says, and you and I obviously disagree about that.

 As for your """"obviously"""": Once again, you seem to be reading sentences out of context. Look at the context of this passage (italics added for emphasis):

""""There was division within the left as to the invasion of Afghanistan.  Nonetheless, an international anti-war movement began to arise; in the U.S. and other countries whose governments enacted legislation analogous to the PATRIOT Act, it was equally a movement in protest of what were perceived to be assaults on civil liberties and immigrant rights.""""

""""Most prominent in this loose coalition were...""""

This is specifically about the protest movement at the time of the Afghanistan invasion (and was more exclusively so in earlier versions, because someone has now inserted """"and Iraq"""" in the next sentence). You say there was no anti-Afganistan-invasion-movement worth mentioning. Don't know where you were. I was in London at the time. 50,000 of us were in Trafalgar Square, that's usually considered a large enough protest to be worth mentioning. I can't say for sure how large rallies were elsewhere at the time, but these links are suggestive: , . Here's a statement of protest by a Canadian Senator on October 26, 2001.. It would take a lot of time to really document the level of protest activity at that time, and it was certainly not nearly as much as later over Iraq, but it is much more relevant to the topic of the Left, becuase opposition was narrower and the Left had a more prominent role.   | Talk 07:16, Jan 4,""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Request For Mediation In Removing Mclellan and The Marine Corps From Manookian's Page [Armenian Issues]
I have tried to informally resolve the editing issues on Arman Manookian to no avail. As a matter of fact, I requested mediation with no response. Moreover, a consensus of Assisting Editors informed me, when I tried to include Arman Manookian on the List of Historically Notable Marines, that Arman Manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of Marine Corps History. Based on that guidance, I deleted references to McClellan [a Marine Corps Historian] on Manookain's page. Now, I note, the very same editors who opined that Manookian did not warrant inclusion on the List of Historically Notable Marines, insist on including McClellan's name and the Marine Corps on Manookian's page for propaganda purposes. I have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from Manookian's accomplishments independent of the United States Marine Corps History. It appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to Armenians. Moreover, 3 linked references to McClellan and the Marine Corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about. Is it about Manookian or Mclellan or the United States Marine Corps? Although I am assuming Good Faith, several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of Bias for a POV and propaganda. I don't believe Mediation is consistent with an Editing War. Moreover, as I stated before in assuming Good Faith, it appears as though Manookian's page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the Marine Corps. Yet when simple solutions are offered, such as including Manookian and McClellan on the List of Historically Notable Marines, it is ignored because his last name ends in IAN and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr. Despite the fact that on the Editor Assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered, I followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason Manookian was taken off the List of Historically Notable Marines was because he was a clerk and McClellan only said nice things about [his name and fame are intertwined with it [Marine Corps History]] him because he felt sorry that Manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first Marine Corps historical artist/illustrator. I followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well.  This type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized. Moreover, there seems to be a concerted effort by so-called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on Marine Corps History that have a problem with historically notable Marines whose last names end in IAN or who volunteered for suicide missions. Apparently, it has something to do with recruitment of Armenians for Martyrdom during WWII and the Marine Corps' subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same Armenian American Marines for political and financial reasons. At this point I ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an Armenian American Marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers.   00:44, 10",0,0,0,0,0,0

My understanding is that Pascal was a much better producer than he was a director. I'm pretty sure I read that it was Shaw who urged him to direct also after Pygmalion, feeling Pascal ought to have total control. But Pascal's style of directing appears to be to work with actors and editors in making directing decisions  for instance getting director Anthony Asquith
and actor Leslie Howard to direct Pygmalion, and working with editor David Lean and actor/director Harold French to assist on Major Barbara. I don't think this style was a secret. The directing talent behind Pygmalion was decidedly Anthony Asquith, who went on to direct another Shaw play """"The Doctor's Dilemma"""" in 1958, another success, showing it was his magic that turned Shaw's plays into cinema more than Pascal. Pascal's success was to gain the trust of Shaw and get him to grant concetions on the script. It was probably a mistake for him to direct """"Caesar and Cleopatra"""" alone, most likely at Shaw's urging, as he didn't really have the director's skill so much as the art of the deal. But he was so afraid of losing Shaw that he most likely agreed to take total control to please Shaw. Sadly, had he kept Asquith, all his later attempts might have succeeded. Far from the megalomania that he is sometimes portrayed as, Pascal appears to have enjoyed deep collaboration, both with the playright, the directors, and the actors. Shaw came to think of Pascal as such a genius that he probably pushed him too far.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Regarding scanning, this is associated with the Channel Tunnel, and the intergovernmental commission requirement to scan 25% of passengers (which Eurostar fulfill by scanning 100% of passengers).  Metal detectors/X-ray machines are also used before boarding high-speed services in Spain.
Regarding local trains.  I suspect you have in mind the impact of the Oresund Railway.  However, Calais is a tiny town and there is very little demand for through traffic.  The Channel Tunnel (and Eurotunnel) impose additional technical requirements (fire protection, train length, redundancy) for transit.

Historiography is not as straight forward as the amateur historians herein would purport to assert. One has to put Cantor in the context of the period in Jewish history in which he lived. Cantor lived at the time when the failed """"German-Jewish symbiosis"""" was still believed possible. It was a time when the poet Heinrich Heine could, and did, assert that conversion to christianity was his """"entry ticket to German society."""" The same is also manifestly true of Cantor.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 LOVES TO MAKE DAVID DUKE SOUND LIKE HE IS JESUS CHRIST I HAVE POSTED THE LAST ACCEPTABLE VERSION OF HIS ARTICLE!

David Ernest Duke (born July 1, 1950) is a former Louisiana State Representative and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

He has made a number of unsuccessful political bids for higher office, including run for the Louisiana State House, Louisiana State Senate, United States Senate, United States House, governor of Louisiana and twice for president of the United States. In 2002 he pled guilty to tax evasion and fraud charges. He is a long-time New Orleans resident and the proud father of Erika and Kristin Duke. 

Youth & Early Adulthood, the Klan and first campaigns

David Duke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to David H. & Maxine Duke. As a Shell Oil engineer his fathers frequently moved his wife, David, and his sister Dotti to numerious locations around the world. The Duke's spent a short period of living in the Netherlands before they settled in Louisiana. Young David became interested in the white nationalist movement at an early age and joined the Klan in 1967. Duke went on to study at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and in 1970, he formed a caucasian campus-group known as the White Youth Alliance. That same year, he made himself known even more by demonstrating in swastika regalia to protest William Kunstler's appearance at Tulane University, LA. He was involved in the campus ROTC, until he was kicked out due to his radical beliefs. In 1971, he went to Laos to teach English to Laotian military officers and serve on cargo flights for Air America over the course of ten weeks.

Duke returned to LSU, graduating in 1974. He became notorious on campus for wearing a Nazi uniform, Ku Klux Klan apparel, and swastika paraphernalia while picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler. The year of his graduation, he was elected Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He attracted attention for trying to modernize the Klan and turn it into a modern nationalist political force. For example, he changed the title of 'Grand Wizard' to 'National Director' and sported a conservative suit as opposed to the traditional white robe. 

In 1976, Duke sought a seat in the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat. In 1978, he left the Klan and two years later formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP). In 1987, he conducted a direct-mail appeal using the identity and mailing-list of the Forsyth County Defense League, in Georgia, without permission, which League officials described as a fund-raising """"scam"""" (detailed in The Rise of David Duke by Tyler Bridges). In 1988, he ran in the Democratic Party primary for President of the United States. After a dismal showing in the Democratic primaries, he appeared on many state ballots as the nominee of the Populist Party and received  approximately 25,000 votes in the 1988 general election.

Using the pseudonym Dorothy Vanderbilt, Dr. Duke published a self-help book for women titled Finders-Keepers in 1976. The publication gives advice to women regarding vaginal exercises, fellatio, anal sex, and anilingus .  The manual is no longer in print and hard to find, however “The Picayune”, a local Mississippi newspaper, managed to find a copy and trace the trail of it’s proceeds to the original  author via the publisher.

In the 1980s, he was heavily involved in gambling and stock market investments, which were covered by the Times-Picayune, as well as by others. Columbia Journalism Review, THE PICAYUNE CATCHES UP WITH DAVID DUKE Attitudes of Mississippi college students toward David Duke before and after seeing the film 'Who Is David Duke?'

In the latter years of the 1980s, Duke sought to revamp his appearance by undergoing plastic surgery, and also shaved off his moustache following his election to the Lo",0,0,0,0,0,0

At the very least, there are many sources that study the reflectance spectra of Munsell chips. One that is in the public domain is at . The server was awfully slow when I tried to access the links with the ASCII data files; I had better luck with ; click the squares for reflectance data. This website is cited in, for instance,

Fernando Ayala, José F. Echávarri, Pilar Renet, and Angel I. Negueruela, """"Use of three tristimulus values from surface reflectance spectra to calculate the principal components for reconstructing these spectra by using only three eigenvectors,"""" J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 23, 2020-2026 (2006) (abstract: ; the article cites the website above as Ref. 24).

One of the classic sources—also cited in the paper above—seems to be

Kenneth L. Kelly, Kasson S. Gibson, and Dorothy Nickerson, """"Tristimulus specifications of the Munsell book of color from spectrophotometric measurements,"""" J. Opt. Soc. Am. 33, 355-376 (1943) (abstract: ).

The Kuehni book I mentioned above lists a bunch of other sources. You can browse it (""""search inside""""), if you have an amazon.com account (used at least once to purchase something from amazon.com itself), here: . 

Incidentally, I now realize that these sources may give enough information to settle the very question I posed. But to really settle it, I would first need the answer to the following: was I wrong in the identification of the Munsell's color in my initial posting? That is,

What is the identity—in the Munsell system—of the Munsell color to which the Wikipedia article is referring? Is it in fact 5RP 5/12?

Having realized my probable mistake above, now I don't understand something else. Look at this statement in the article:
…professional artists, following Munsell color system… regard purple as being synonymous with the red-violet color shown at right, in order to clearly distinguish purple from violet…
In what sense are artists supposed to be """"following Munsell"""" here? Obviously not in nomenclature. Is it the case that the artists do use Munsell's colors in their work, but change the names (e.g. Munsell's purple → artist's violet, and Munsell's red-purple → artist's purple)? I'd rewrite this if I understood what is attempted to be said here.

The point is that it's not a single, uniform feature and should therefor not be summarized in one single term. It's just a non-linguistic definition that actually means something completely different in musical (and psychological?) context.
What is described in melodic accent is actually called tonal word accent and this was first recorded in the 1920s by the German linguist Ernest A. Meyer in his two volume-work Die Intonation den Schwedischen (""""The Intonation of Swedish""""), and systematically described in Eva Gårding's The Scandinavian Word Accents (1977), based mostly on Meyer's material.

Thanks, impartial reader, but your comments are a little on the general side.  Based on bitter personal experience over many years, I've long given up on achieving """"consensus"""" on something as controversial of monetary theory.  As Gregalton has pointed out on the debt-based monetary system talk page, it's not like """"quilting"""".  How money should be produced and distributed in the modern economy is (if you hadn't already noticed) a slightly contentious issue.  Contentious enough for the argument to be concluded with an assassin's bullet (at least according to some monetary historians).  The question is not my manners, which I acknowledge are non-existent, but whether someone should DELETE what I have written ON MY OWN TALK PAGE on this basis, and threaten ominously """"you will not be warned again"""" (I'm now reflexively turning around all the time to check how long Coren's knife is).  Instead of deleting and threatening, how about editors take the time to make constructive comments and suggestions to amend the text?  I can live with not being liked.  However if someone wants to take the time to actively """"terminate"""" me ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, they can't expect to do it without a fight and some risk to their own... how should I put this... tranquility.  Alternatively they can leave me the Hell alone and let others read what they want to read.  No one is pushing anyone's face into the computer screen to read what I've writen.

Even though I'm confident I can find it, it is also likely it won't be related to the Slutwalk, and even less likely that it's an answer to that specific response. And that's where I'm not sure on where would I be allowed to place the evidence. Not after the response, I guess, but would it be admissible all the way to the top, right after the words of Sanguinetti? Or somewhere in the middle? Or does it also depend on the kind of sources I find? Also, still supposing I find good material disproving these sayings, does it affect the possible neutrality of the article, or is this considered a minor detail? I'm not trying to get specific answers for this, but maybe someone can point me in the right direction. I just wouldn't like to start adding information in a misguided way, which would end up with me asking stuff here anyway...

Well if you want to sincerely discuss it I can make an exception as I have the expertise and have some time so I ask you first to consider the full context of the selections you outline. The Aurobindo letter begins: """"All these experiences are of the same nature and what applies to one applies to another. Apart from some experiences of a personal character, the rest are either idea-truths, such as pour down into the consciousness from above when one gets into touch with certain planes of being, or strong formations from the larger mental and vital worlds which, when one is directly open to these worlds, rush in and want to use the sadhak for their fulfilment. These things, when they pour down or come in, present themselves with a great force, a vivid sense of inspiration or illumination, much sensation of light and joy, an impression of widening and power. The sadhak feels himself freed from the normal limits, projected into a wonderful new world of experience, filled and enlarged and exalted; what comes associates itself, besides, with his aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi; it is represented even as itself that realisation and fulfillment."""" In short they are talking about planes of consciousness (basically astral and mental planes) which more experienced occultists are familiar with as actual realms. Ancient occult lore is true that there are stages of awakening to these planes which is what is meant but the danger is in not being able to handle the energies and conscious influences, archetypal forms and beings there so that one becomes more of an intermediate zone medium (a sad state some of us have actually observed which is why Kazlev popularized the concept). This becomes clearer once you read the full text of Paul Brunton's Chapter on the Intermediate Zone here: http://paulbrunton.org/notebooks/16/12. 

Brunton's beginning point is that: """"The pathway of the mystical goal is strewn with human wreckage. Why? Several reasons would be needed to give a complete answer but one of the most important is this: Between the state of ordinary man and the state of the matured mystic there lies a perilous and deceptive psychological region which has been given various names in mystical literature. It has been called the astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of illusion, and so on. The early efforts of all aspirants in concentration, meditation, self-conquest, and study, bring them into this region. But once here their egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, their emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, their imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained. The consequence of failure to negotiate these changes properly is swollen vanity, superstitious credulity, emotions run riot, and imagination gone wild. The safeguards against all this are first, submission to the philosophic discipline and second, submission to competent guidance."""" 

I appreciate that you have more of a Buddhist orientation in your views while the sources use Hindu based concepts. In this case to say that the IZ is similar to a Buddhist concept of a spiritual bypass which is """"a tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks"""" is sufficiently related to the IZ concepts of Aurobindo and Brunton to justify combining rather than cross referencing them, is to miss the import of the IZ concept. You would be familiar with the Buddhist wheel of life with its different realms of being. A more Buddhist way to look at it would be that you have to pass the tests of illusion and influences of certain beings of each realm up to and including Mara to truly get through the IZ (and free of the wheel), and it is too dangerous without a proper guide. While Buddha (or for that matter any enlightened being) is fully awake and present on every level of the wheel) the aspirant is only awakening slowly from the dream and can be easily confused. Even highly practiced, relatively balanced and well meaning spiritual people can and do fail to pass through the IZ. The """"spiritual bypass"""" is a concept far too psychological to express the broader meaning of the IZ. 

So I think your idea has some merit and certainly the article can and should be improved but a better solution would be to improved the cross referencing and not just force an integration of the terms. I hope you take the time to thoroughly review Aurobindo and Brunton's full exposition of the concept before pushing ahead. I have no difficulty with you taking over lead on the article in that case. All I ask is that editors be thorough and give some weight to those with expertise on a specific topic.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

84ee2176bb1013ca,"Meijer Gardens, American Horse, Statue copyright
Hi Asher196. I have come here to follow up with you about Image:MeijerGardensAmericanHorse.jpg‎. I used to contribute a lot of images to wikipedia, back about a year and a half ago I would make trips to specific locations to take high quality pictures for inclusion on Wikipedia. In doing so, I learned more about copyright of photography than most lawyers do (because most lawyers do not work in the copyright space). Suffice to say that your perception of image copyright is an incorrect one. A summary of image copyright has been written elsewhere far better than I can try here, but i am so out of practice on WP I cannot find it. First, please carefully read the copyright template that I have placed upon this image. The image is copyrighted because it is a 2d representation of a 3d statue. Statues, just like paintings, soda can artwork, music and movies are copyrightable. As such, one cannot make derivitives of that work that one can license (i.e. take a picture). If one takes a photograph of a statue, the original copyright holder still retains rights over that image, rights that can only be bent through the implying the fair use provisions of copyright law.

I was involved in a rather epic struggle between good (fair use) and evil (anti-copyright) people on Wikipedia, one that we sadly lost because this project is dominated by people who are so leftist and anti establishment that they desire nothing short of completely free. Sadly, this is a battle my side eventually was overcome by noise and numbers generally, but even these nazi's must admit defeat in the face of being able to include photographs of statues. There is no other option. One simply cannot create public domain or freely licensable photographs of statues. I hope this post brings to you a greater understanding of copyright of images and will serve you in your future editing.",0,0,0,0,0,0

e4d907f77d1156ab,"I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.

But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.

Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.

For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.

One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.

So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).

So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.

I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. 

I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.

This was dismissed.

Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.

That too was dismissed.

So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.

Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)

In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.

So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.

Two choices.

Stop posting completely

Try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.

Hence the challenge.

I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.

I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.

You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.

I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.

So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.

So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.

Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers. If it is accepted though I shall return just the once, to link to the article!   16:57, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Whilst Dr. Beck asked only that we take down the BDI-II, I still have to pay $4 a copy for the original BDI-I so I must assume that's under copyright and licence as well. I'm going to try and find some relevant bits from WP:C to justify (or not) removing the links. From what I can see the relevant text is here: 
Linking to copyrighted works
""""External sites can possibly violate copyright. Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone else's copyright. If it is, please do not link to the page. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry). Also, linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else's work sheds a bad light on us. If the site in question is making fair use of the material, linking is fine.""""
From what I can tell, I think that the sites that are hosting the BDI-I and BDI-II are violating copyright. Most of them don't say that they have permission to use the instrument, they don't cite the original paper, and in the licence when you buy a copy it explicitly says not to make electronic copies. Now each of these separate users may have made a licence deal with Harcourt individually, but it seems unlikely. A lot of the google hits that come up are appendices and lecture notes from university projects; I don't think there is an exemption for educational use, but then university psychology departments often buy a """"portfolio"""" of test copyrights for limited use. This would not normally extend to use on the web however. In terms of next steps, I actually think this is one of the rare occasions where a consensus is not the way to go, but rather we could list the issue at WP:CP?
If it's an issue of helping depressed people, I'm not sure having people just fill out the form will do them much good. After all it just produces a number, it's only useful in context. One option would be to have a link to a therapeutic community as these may be of some help . For instance, MoodGym is a site which allows users to self-administer cognitive behavioral strategies .

Fanboy is a term used to describe an individual (usually male; the feminine version fangirl may be used for females) who is utterly devoted to a single fannish subject, or to a single point of view within that subject, often to the point where it is considered an obsession. Fanboys remain loyal to their particular obsession, disregarding any factors (often including logic) that differ from their point of view. 

 Background 
Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled. Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject, often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack. They will readily engage in debates, but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts. For example, a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsession's rivals. Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject. The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt, socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudo-intellectual. Fanboys  are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements. 

As electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as """"fanboys."""" Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in comic book circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom.  The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans. The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex.

The term fangirl, while similar, often carries slightly different connotations. The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan, regardless of obsessive qualities or not, and is often used with overtones of """"teenybopper"""".

History of fanboys and the term
The term """"fanboy"""" is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. It is often used in a derogatory manner by other, less obsessed fans. The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone immersed in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. Common subjects of reverence by fanboys are specific: TV shows; movies; music; anime; comic books; cars; video game consoles, video games and MMORPGs; and computer operating systems, hardware and software.
 
Popular depictions of Fanboy stereotypes include the Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons and columnist Larry Groznic from the satirical newspaper The Onion.  In the songs of the fannish parody musician Luke Ski, many characters proudly consider themselves fanboys.

The earliest published uses of the word """"fanboy"""" have been dated to 1982.  One reference is to the cover of the """"Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide"""".  On this cover page are sketched overweight, overzealous comic book collectors wearing T-shirts that state """"Fanboys of America,"""" who are describing the extreme measures they would go to, including moving to San Francisco, to preserve their comics.

Also published in 1982, a comic strip appeared in Jim Engel and Chuck Fiala's """"Fandom Confidential"""" comic.  In the strip, Jim and Chuck met comic artist/writer John Byrne and collapsed into """"mindless paroxysms of adoration.""""  The John Byrne character responded that they were """"a couple of fanboys in bondage"""" (a play on words referring to a Monty Python sketch in which an Elizabethan era character reads what she claims to be a new Shakespeare work called """"Gay Boys in Bondage"""". http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1;=Miscellaneous+Questions#154 Another early use is in a smart-alec editorial reply by """"Ambush Bug"""" to a letter in his comic in 1985.

I agree that it's a contentious statement, but don't you see that it's equally contentious to assert that I """"clearly"""" acted in ways which were at best likely to mislead others? I'm under no obligation (that I'm aware of) to explicitly call out that the various IP addresses I use are all being used by me. That said, I've also never denied it. Frankly, no one has seemed to have a problem figuring it out, so I'm not sure anyone's been seriously mislead to begin with. I'm not hiding my writing style or anything.
E.g. 
My use of wikipedia being my *reading* use, as is made clear by the statement """"those orange banners are annoying."""" I didn't evade the block until such point when I thought it had been communicated that editing under a different IP wouldn't be considered evasion. As User:Dennis Brown pointed out to me, IP addresses aren't humans; they're more akin to telephone numbers. It follows that a block applied to a telephone number applies to that telephone number. If the intention was to stop me, personally, from editing Wikipedia, shouldn't it have been a ban? (Also, you must be aware that statements like """"to twist logic in your defense"""" fail to AGF.)
At this point, I'm pretty sure that everyone has taken it as granted that I'm being deceptive simply by choosing not to register for an account. If that's the case, this really doesn't seem like the encyclopedia that anyone is encouraged to edit boldly. Also, you're misconstruing what I admitted (see above.)
Lastly, (and this relates to all of your points in general), you yourself said that it was reasonable to invoke IAR (above) in order to improve Wikipedia, despite the block. If that was the case for calling attention to a bad edit, why not a bad policy?

2a5572cf6932bc99,"""::Addendum: I think I may have found the source of the confusion.  Within the medical establishment, a medical student who has not yet received his or her MD is referred to as an """"undergraduate"""", in contrast with residents who've received their MDs but are not yet board-certified.  In that context, a medical student is an """"undergraduate"""" because he or she has not graduated from the MD program.  However, that does not mean that an MD is an """"undergraduate degree"""" as that term is usually understood in the US.  That term is reserved for bachelor degrees; any program (such as medical school or law school) which is generally attained after four-year college is called a """"graduate program"""", and the degrees it grants are """"graduate degrees"""".

I think that the current wording is adequate to avoid this confusion.  It's worth noting that in practice, it's extremely rare to find a medical student in the US who doesn't already have a degree from a four-year college.  My wife's a medical student, and every one of her classmates has a BS or BA. — (talk • contribs)

It's way too late to write this, but I have a late start tomorrow. You must NEVER allow people to disparage you for having served. What you did is a source of pride and self-respect. You must always remember this. 

Years ago I lived up in BKK, and my very best friend (Australian ex-special forces) trained some of you guys out in Cambodia. He always commented on how good you were. 

My friend was eventually shot dead outside his house in BKK back in 2001. That changed my life. But I'll tell you a story that happened in the late 90's. My friend and I did """"a mission"""" in Burma and (after a series of events which I won't describe) ended up in a remote village in the middle of nowhere. The village was tiny, and tethered to a pole next to a teak tree was a strange-looking pig. But it wasn't a pig; nor was it a cow. It was the oddest-looking animal we'd ever seen. 

And then my friend worked it out  the animal was a Javan rhinoceros. True story.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you really want to still keep away the info that you deleted, I will accept that, even though I do not understand why, however I will not allow anyone to just delete info in the first paragraph as it is now. It is, as I said, promotional. All first paragraphs of other nations are equally as 'promotional' (as you say) and captivating. Wikipedia, I agree, is not a tourist brochure, yet you always include the best achievements of the country in the intro. 

Also, what I mean by 'attacking' Italy-related articles is that many people seem to not want pages to change and there is constant edit-wars, reverting and deleting. Rather than deleting disputable info, I believe that it is better to improve it, rather than revertion. As I've only edited a few Italian articles, it could be only concerning those pages, but that's what I see in that.

Ok, let's just leave the intro as it is now. If you want sources for the info you deleted, I could go and find some.

 Are redlinks bad form? 
 regarding the Co-Freemasonry article: 

I was under the impression that redlinks in articles were quite acceptable, as long as they point to (nonexistent) articles on notable subjects that could or should be created. I could reinstate the links and create stubs for them all, but that would involve quite a bit of work; isn't the point that redlinks serve as useful signposts for others who might be able to contribute material? I'd like to put at least some of the redlinks back in...

In fact, I've just done a quick search and found Wikipedia:Red link, which agrees with what I thought. I'll add the redlinks back, checking as I go to make sure they're all notable and desirable articles. ☻ 

Check it, Fuzz: Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context. I agree, not all of them exactly need to be removed, but there's too many. Check policy, determine what should be linked, & relink it...:-)  

Righto, I have checked it, and I stick by my position. None of the redlinks should be removed. They are all relevant to the article. Please excuse me if I'm being dense, but which particular redlinks do you believe are irrelevant? Some of the blue-linked dates should be unlinked (those not containing both month and day, as per Wikipedia:Dates); apart from that, the links in the article are fine. ☻ 

Whatev's...;~) the idea of leaving many red links in is to give people an idea of articles which should probably be created, especially in a newly-created article. If they stay too long, &/or the article becomes long-of-tooth, then they should almost always be removed. Obviously, do as you feel best. I'm for sure not going to express too much care, not there...  

Thank-you for your comments. I'm not too worried now. I've run roughshod over people in the past, and I know how easy it is to do. At the moment I'm probably in danger of running roughshod over some of the people who claim to be Wiccan but have no initiatory lineage. Just as you don't consider Co-Freemasons to be Freemasons, I don't consider them to be Wiccan. The thing is, everyone editing here is doing so because there's a subject that's important to them, so there are bound to be disagreements. I feel like we're all on the same side, though, ultimately: our goal is to establish truth (or rather the wikipedia equivalent, verifiability), regardless of how many of our preconceived opinions are sacrificed in the process. ☻

Grye - Just took a look at the stuff you have been doing on the Freemason/citation project (your proposed templates etc.) ... WOW.  Thanks for what was obviously a lot of hard work.

I don't watch the Obligations page, but the gist of the discussion was that we can't ascertain the validity of what's in Duncan, so if it's missing for the moment, it's really not a huge issue.  I don't like that article because it's not really an """"article""""; it's just some nonsense to get a sort of OMG!!!! MASONIC SECRETZ!!!!!1111 reaction and push people's buttons, as it doesn't discuss so much as reproduce verbatim, and the only reason that article is not gone due to copyvio is because it's almost 200 years out of date and not subject to copyright law.

Great sentiment, but the rules and policies are, in many cases, inherently, explicitly bad. If they were fundamentally sound, they wouldn't yield such preposterous results they so often do, particularly on political/economics articles. Believe it or not, but I've actually try to edit within those flaws, and it doesn't work. 

OR is one of my favorites. You can add completely relevant, well-sourced text with great informative value, but are explicitly prohibited from doing so, and are thus unable to correct a distorted rendition on a given topic. When editing so called fringe articles, this becomes almost comical. Since fringe by its very definition means that it is outside what is considered mainstream, it is easy to find mainstream articles that criticizes the fringe position, but nigh on impossible to find a mainstream source that counters that position, since the mainstream by and large is critical of that position. So you need to find an article that explicitly counters the (arbitrary chosen) article used by the mainstream editor. Obviously that will be very difficult, since fringe articles are, again, by its very definition, scarce. And if you do find one, the mainstream editor calls on the RS rule, thus ruling out the use of that source because, and here's the kicker, its fringe. And there is nothing you can do about it, because that is what the rules say. Talk about catch 22.

Thus you can add whatever demonstrably false bullshit you want in order to inflate the criticism of the fringe position. This easy to do, since there's an endless amount of mainstream articles to choose from. These criticisms become virtually impossible to counter because of the OR, RS or some other bullshit rule. According to the rules, it is better to have false and distortive information on the article (provided it is critical) than correct and informative material. This is not the consequence of some manipulation of otherwise good rules and policies, this is the explicit goal and purpose of WP. Truth is not an issue, the High Lord Jimmy Wales tells us, only whatever delusional, bullshit claims that can be """"verified"""" by delusional, bullshit mainstream sources.

I've got blocked many times, that is true. But why I have got blocked? Well, in most cases it's the result of me trying to defend an article against what any sensible person would have to call vandalism. But of course, vandalism is just keeping with rules and policies in the WP world. Also, if you happen to be alone in defending a certain edit, and you have two opponents, they can just take turns reverting your edit until you hit the 3rr rule. Another charming aspect of the WP rules and policies.

So no, the rules and policies are not mostly okay. Very far from it. They are the very reason why WP cannot be used as source on information about economics, not even in a youtube commentary debate. It works fine when it comes to physics or other natural sciences. But not when it comes to economics. That is a shame, but it is the inevitable consequence of fundamentally flawed rules and policies and the implementation thereof. I may not have been around as long as you have, but I've been around long enough to know how fucked up WP's rules and policies are. And they are holding WP back.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Jim1138 

Hi.

How did you get involved in this business with ?

Jim1138 left an erroneous and damaging Edit Warring warning on my page.

You can see what he did here. In the 'History' section, he replaced an entirely duplicated section, duplicating the content immediately above it. He called it an """"Unexplained removal of content"""". No content had been removed, it had only been paragraphed ... which he then duplication. 

He was obviously in the wrong. He obviously paid no attention to the content. 

Then he left the erroneous and damaging bad mark which I have asked him politely to apologise, and remove and erase it.

It strikes me it would take a lot less effort just to do so than all this running around.

It is not a """"content issue"""", it was bullying. 

Can you remove and erase it? I don't want it to be left to be used against me, as already happened.

Despite what countless secondary sources that didn't bother do their research say, there is zero evidence (none) that whalers caused the extinction of gray whales in the North Atlantic. This is just another stupid assumption made again and again by lazy researchers. We don't know why they went extinct. We know they were hunted off Iceland, perhaps New England (iirc), and perhaps elsewhere (the Basques were at least aware of them c. 1611). We don't know the historic size of that population, how long they were hunted, how many were caught per year, or the composition (sex, age) of the catch. Do not restore my revert until you find proof (not circumstantial evidence, e.g. increase in whaling activity on entirely different species coincided with the disappearance of the gray whale in the North Atlantic) that whaling was the cause of the extinction of Atlantic gray whales (good luck with that, because you won't find it).",0,0,0,0,0,0

Listen, I don't believe that Greece is 98% Greek.

Perhaps the 98% figure pertains to the remaining 90% which would be something like 88.2% of the total population. I think all this speculation qualifies as original research though. What is interesting is the question of """"what are the Roma (Gypsies/Τσιγγάνοι)?"""" According to the Greek government again, they number about 200,000 - are they included in the ethnic Greeks figure? According to official statistics again (1991 census), the Thrace minority is 0.98% of the total population at that time (about 28.8% of the total population of Thace at that time).

fddec5ab15546ee2,"Hi, Benne. Thank you for unearthing this need for disambiguation. I think that Mansura is usually spelled with a ta marbuta as its final letter: منصورة (manṣūrä). This comes frot the root نصر (naṣara) meaning 'help' or 'make victorious' (interestingly, in derived form II it means 'Christianize'). Therefore, منصور (manṣūr) means 'helped', 'supported', 'victorious'. The place name is the feminine version of this, perhaps representing the old accusative (with locative meaning). In Arabic, many place names begin with the definite article. Sometimes the article is kept in trasliteration and sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it's transliterated as Al and sometimes it's El. The word itself could be transliterated as Mansura, Mansoura, Mansoora, Mansurah, Mansourah, Mansoorah, Mansureh, Mansoureh, Mansooreh. It would make sense to have all of these alternatives, with and without alternatives of definite article, linking to a disambiguation page. However, the Egyptian Mansurah is by far the most important of these, so it might take precedence over the disambig. I'll see if I can tidy it up a little. —",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Blocking Mardyks (2012) 

Excellent work there Shii. We can't have his kind getting us to think about what the Maya actually say about their own prophecies. We insulted him, offended him and abused him and he just had to be ethical and persistant. BLOCK those Mother Fukkers!!! Taking out the entire Santa Fe Public Library system is a great preemptive strike also. There may be others of his kind, that sympathize with those """"Indians"""". These people actually LOVE the Earth and that is without reliable sources! We kicked their asses and have the right to write THEIR history and interpret THEIR sacred teachings however we please. We need more from college students who have been indoctrinated in the Church of Academia. That piece by Stitler is one of the most exaggerated and opinionated and so yeah, use that as the title of the page! And by all means give John MAJOR Jenkins his own section. Not a single scholar or Mayanist agrees with his appropriated theory and this kind of hypocrisy and arrogance is what Wiki is all about. We can get away with it, by continuing to use our power to censor free thinkers like Mardyks and his kind. Sony Pictures is paying us all off with tickets, so let us know how many you want.

It is generally considered acceptable to remove personal attacks, though there are some who disagree with that. If when you remove a personal attack you are reverted, then do not remove it again. Instead seek an outside party to investigate, preferably on some sort of public noticeboard. I really do not know the first thing about the Ireland dispute and from what little I have heard I don't want to touch it with a 10 foot poll.

No, there are not different standards for different editors. There is however a gap between the treatment of those who know how to work with the system, and those who do not grasp the intricate details. While Wikipedia claims not to be a bureaucracy does in fact share many similar traits with a bureaucracy. Knowing the correct """"form"""", noticeboard or procedure will take you far, knowing the tone and content expected from said processes and presenting in that fashion will take you even farther. It is a bit of a shame that such an advantage is given to those who know the ins and outs but it is the way things end up working here. Chillum 01:01, 14""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The Vedic Rajas & old Kshatriyas(tribals),not satisfied with their married wives,had frequently children by their female slaves,who although not legitimate successors to the throne,these illegitimate children were styled Rajpoots,or the children of Rajas""""The word """"Rajput"""" is used in certain parts of Rajasthan to denote the illegitimate sons of a Kshatriya chief or Zamidar."""" [Mahajan: 1972: 550 ff.] The conclusion is obvious that they were not considered by the original residentsto be respectable, to start with. This is because """"Raaja"""" means royal but """"Raj"""" means semen. The progeny of mixed marriages is even now called by that name in some parts. The condition of woman was deteriorating. The question of women education was unthinkable. Obscene Art flourished during Rajput age. The originality of the ancient times was lost and the ancient culture degenerated.

""""Since 2009, it began airing a small amount of live-action programming, specifically movies from Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema, both of which are also owned by Time Warner.""""  Rewrite like this, """"In 2009 it started airing live-action programming, including movies from Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema.""""  No one cares that they're owned by Time Warner.
 See WP:LEAD for instructions on what should be in a good lead.  The lead should be a summary of the entire article and this lead should be enhanced to include every subject within the article (written in a summary style).

 The clean up banner is legitimate and should be addressed.  Usually clean up banners should be handled before the article is listed at WP:PR.  I can see a number of  templates in the following sections.  These should be addressed and the sourcing improved.
 As a general rule every paragraph should have at least one source, and more if there are multiple assertions.
 See WP:INCITE for reference anchor placement.  They don't go in the middle of the sentence but rather at the end unless the assertion is very controversial.
 The parenthetical reference in the first sentence is too detailed.  Give a few examples of what was acquired and leave it at that.
 Watch out for one sentence paragraphs.  These stubs are not acceptable at GAC.  Consider combining or expanding.
 Make sure titles are always italicized even when not linked.
 What is meant by the """"Powerhouse era""""?  What is powerhouse music?  

Programming

 This is a section with no prose.  Not good.  Sections with just a tophat are unnecessary.  Either add some prose or remove the section.  I think you fold in most of the programming info in the previous section.

 Here is a section """"Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall"""" see above.

References

 The key to references is consistency.  Make sure every website ref has at least the title, url, publisher, and accessdate.
 You probably want to use templates like  to help with consistency.
 Deviantart appears to be a blog or discussion forum.  This is not a credible reference.  See WP:CITE and WP:VERIFY for instructions on credible references.  Avoid blogs, forums, chat rooms, social networking sites etc.

Overall

 As stated above the article needs a lot more referencing.  This will be a major sticking point if you want it to pass GAC.  * I would also seek out someone who can do a thorough copy edit.
 There isn't much about the financing of the channel, advertising revenue, demographics that sort of thing.  It would be nice to see some more information on these topics.
 This concludes my review.  Please contact me on my talk page if you have specific questions.  Best of luck to you.

I've fix the issue. Some movies were carried from 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures which are not owned by Time Warner. I've improved some  it a little bit, but the article needs to be rewrite and remove any blog, user and fan sites which are not reliable. Any reliable sources can be added per WP:V and WP:RS. Remember,  is recommended. Good luck improving the article.  (Talk / Contributions) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

In other markets, the car was sold as a Ford.

c838e7480b70f8bf,"As far as Muslims are concerned any criticism of Islam is hate speech. I have been a Muslim for five years and know perfectly the hatred that Muslims have for apostates and the level of intolerance towards their critics. Been there, done that myself, without even being aware of it. It all seemed normal to do. Today I find myself on the other side of the fence. Quoting opinions contrary to those believed by Muslims is not hate speech. The Quran is filled with hate speech. Look at the article Ali Sina for example: that is hate speech. The very language is despiteful. My every contribution to Islamofascims, Islamofobia and Ali Sina are removed. The only reason is because they are not in agreement with Islamic creed. We must not allow Wikipedia to be converted into an Islamic tool of propaganda. Both views must be expressed equally. Take the example of Sina’s page. There we have six comments made by anonymous Muslims calling him all names including a mischievous liar, a rabid anti Islamist, Islamophobe, etc. In the paragraph that said “Ali Sina is a controversial personality” I quoted an example of how diverse are the opinions of Sina’s fans from those of his foes.  This is not to agree with those opinions. Muslims resisted this example tooth and nail, with all inane and invalid excuses. I made it clear that this is not an endorsement of those views and the notability of the people making those allegations or praises are not important. They are just a sample of what people say about him. It goes from one extreme to another. I think both examples should be stated so the claim that he is a controversial is supported with these examples. Why Muslims do not want to have any mention of what Sina’s fans say about him and only the insults of his foes are mentioned? Any fool will see this article is written by people with an axe to grind against it subject. 
Since I joined Wikipedia, every contribution I made was removed and reverted and incidentally those who removed them were invariably Muslims. Am I not allowed to put the two together and conclude that this is Islamic zealotry at work? OceanSplash13.Dec. 2005 18:20",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Current continental drift theory which suggest a super continent exist on one side of the planet defies the laws of physics. The material that makes up rock is much denser than water. When you examine the current distribution of mass on the planet, and keep in mind the laws of gravity, the bulk of the mass exist in quasi pyramid structure which is a result of the global equalization of these laws. The only way a mass continent would be formed would be if the earths crusts was too thick for the continental drift to even work(mass of the super continent is insignificant in comparison to the relative mass of each existing crust-really thick) .

Hi:
Your remarks hit the nail on the head. The Stalin article is a typical example of the left wing anti-American bias that is considered NPV by the folks at Wikipedia. I refuse to contribute as long as such nonsense is tolerated.
